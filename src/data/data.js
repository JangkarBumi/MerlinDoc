She received her medical degree at the University of Medicine and Dentistry – Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and completed her residency training at the New York-Presbyterian Hospital Weill Cornell Medical Center.  She initiated her career at New York University Langone Medical Center, where her career focus was on benign gynecological conditions and women’s health.  In 2011 she returned to New York-Presbyterian Hospital Weill Cornell Medical Center to join the faculty as an Assistant Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology.\n\nDr. Havryliuk provides care in all aspects of gynecology and women’s health including the management of contraception, abnormal pap smears, endometriosis, abnormal uterine bleeding, hormone replacement therapy, as well as preventative care.  In addition, Dr. Havryliuk has a special interest in the surgical management of fibroids and adnexal masses.  When indicated, she strives to offer all of her patients minimally invasive therapy using robotically assisted surgery.  Robotically assisted surgery provides the surgeon increased precision and control, allowing for the treatment of complex pathologies using small incisions.  As compared to conventional surgery, it provides patients with less post-operative pain and enables a faster recovery.\n\nDr. Havryliuk has also fostered collaborations with other departments within the medical center in order to offer a multidisciplinary and comprehensive approach.  This is particularly true with regards to the treatment of fibroids, where she performs complex hysteroscopic resections of fibroids following uterine fibroid embolization, performed by the department of Interventional Radiology.\n\nLastly, Dr. Havryliuk’s goal is to always establish an environment that is conducive to an open and clear dialogue with her patients.  Her belief is that patients do better when they fully understand their condition and are empowered and confident through a thoughtful and well-informed decision making process."},"ratings":[{"active":true,"provider":"betterdoctor","provider_uid":"28a7ddd205b204bddb0dc51c05960fd3","rating":5,"review_count":0,"image_url_small":"https://asset2.betterdoctor.com/assets/consumer/stars/stars-small-5.0.png","image_url_small_2x":"https://asset2.betterdoctor.com/assets/consumer/stars/stars-small-5.0@2x.png","image_url_large":"https://asset2.betterdoctor.com/assets/consumer/stars/stars-large-5.0.png","image_url_large_2x":"https://asset2.betterdoctor.com/assets/consumer/stars/stars-large-5.0@2x.png"}],"insurances":[{"insurance_plan":{"uid":"aetna-aetnamanagedchoiceposopenaccess","name":"Aetna Managed Choice POS Open Access","category":["medical"]},"insurance_provider":{"uid":"aetna","name":"Aetna"}},{"insurance_plan":{"uid":"oxfordhealth-oxfordfreedom","name":"Oxford Freedom","category":["medical"]},"insurance_provider":{"uid":"oxfordhealth","name":"Oxford Health"}},{"insurance_plan":{"uid":"oxfordhealth-oxfordliberty","name":"Oxford Liberty","category":["medical"]},"insurance_provider":{"uid":"oxfordhealth","name":"Oxford Health"}},{"insurance_plan":{"uid":"empirebcbs-empirepathwayenhancedguidedaccess","name":"Empire Pathway Enhanced Guided Access","category":["medical"]},"insurance_provider":{"uid":"bcbs","name":"BCBS"}},{"insurance_plan":{"uid":"empirebcbs-empirehmo","name":"Empire HMO","category":["medical"]},"insurance_provider":{"uid":"bcbs","name":"BCBS"}},{"insurance_plan":{"uid":"gwhcigna-greatwestppo","name":"Great West PPO","category":["medical"]},"insurance_provider":{"uid":"cigna","name":"Cigna"}},{"insurance_plan":{"uid":"unitedhealthcare-uhcchoicepluspos","name":"UHC Choice Plus POS","category":["medical"]},"insurance_provider":{"uid":"unitedhealthcare","name":"United Healthcare"}},{"insurance_plan":{"uid":"unitedhealthcare-uhcnavigatehmo","name":"UHC Navigate HMO","category":["medical"]},"insurance_provider":{"uid":"unitedhealthcare","name":"United Healthcare"}},{"insurance_plan":{"uid":"unitedhealthcare-uhcnavigatepos","name":"UHC Navigate POS","category":["medical"]},"insurance_provider":{"uid":"unitedhealthcare","name":"United Healthcare"}},{"insurance_plan":{"uid":"unitedhealthcare-uhcoptionsppo","name":"UHC Options PPO","category":["medical"]},"insurance_provider":{"uid":"unitedhealthcare","name":"United Healthcare"}},{"insurance_plan":{"uid":"capitaldistrictphysicianshealthplan-cdphpppo","name":"CDPHP PPO","category":["medical"]},"insurance_provider":{"uid":"capitaldistrictphysicianshealthplan","name":"Capital District Physicians Health Plan"}},{"insurance_plan":{"uid":"multiplan-multiplanppo","name":"Multiplan PPO","category":["medical"]},"insurance_provider":{"uid":"multiplan","name":"Multiplan"}},{"insurance_plan":{"uid":"multiplan-phcsppo","name":"PHCS PPO","category":["medical"]},"insurance_provider":{"uid":"multiplan","name":"Multiplan"}},{"insurance_plan":{"uid":"magnacare-magnacareppo","name":"MagnaCare PPO","category":["medical"]},"insurance_provider":{"uid":"magnacare","name":"MagnaCare"}},{"insurance_plan":{"uid":"empirebcbs-empirepathwayenhancedguidedaccess","name":"Empire Pathway Enhanced Guided Access","category":["medical"]},"insurance_provider":{"uid":"bcbs","name":"BCBS"}},{"insurance_plan":{"uid":"empirebcbs-empireppo","name":"Empire PPO","category":["medical"]},"insurance_provider":{"uid":"bcbs","name":"BCBS"}},{"insurance_plan":{"uid":"empirebcbs-empireprismepobluepriority","name":"Empire Prism EPO -

In high school I became a peer counselor where I helped other teenagers who, like myself, were struggling with their emotions, burgeoning politics (it was 1970 after all! ) and the normal angst of adolescence. In college I majored in biology with a minor in sociology. As I considered my future, I knew I wanted to combine my love of science, particulary biology, with my love of sociology and psychology\t… Medicine was the perfect choice for the blend of my passions and talent.\nAs I coursed through college, I was introduced to women’s studies. In medical school my clerkship in Obstetrics and Gynecology excited me the most. I thus chose a residency and specialization in this field because, as a feminist, I felt I would have the opportunity to positively impact women’s lives. Also, as I love working with my hands, practicing surgery and delivering babies was particularly appealing to me.\nNow 25 years later I have no regrets. My experiences have been thrilling and rewarding beyond my expectations. I look forward to many more years, practicing medicine, centered in compassion, coupled with curiosity and continual learning to improve my craft."},"ratings":[{"active":true,"provider":"yelp","provider_uid":"enzenbacher-janis-l-md-piermont","provider_url":"http://www.yelp.com/biz/enzenbacher-janis-l-md-piermont"},{"active":true,"provider":"betterdoctor","provider_uid":"9c4cc8f3e14003a79a93e2b8e2771a4d","rating":5,"review_count":0,"image_url_small":"https://asset2.betterdoctor.com/assets/consumer/stars/stars-small-5.0.png","image_url_small_2x":"https://asset2.betterdoctor.com/assets/consumer/stars/stars-small-5.0@2x.png","image_url_large":"https://asset2.betterdoctor.com/assets/consumer/stars/stars-large-5.0.png","image_url_large_2x":"https://asset2.betterdoctor.com/assets/consumer/stars/stars-large-5.0@2x.png"}],"insurances":[{"insurance_plan":{"uid":"cigna-cignappo","name":"CIGNA
